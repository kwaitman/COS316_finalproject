Instructions to run the program:
First, download a local copy of our codebase to your computer by cloning this git repository.

Once you have your copy, make a ‘.env’ file with content ‘SECRET_KEY=finalproject’ in the same directory. Then, open up a new terminal and run app.py however you normally run python programs (preceded by either python or python3). At this point, type ‘localhost:5000’ into your browser to access our program. The user login page will appear, and you should be good to go from here.
If an issue occurs in running the program, ensure that you have the correct programs installed, such as python, flask, and dotenv. For a more detailed explanation of what package is missing, check the message output on your terminal.

Note: the database of usernames and passwords is generated the first time you run the program. To reset it, simply delete app.db and rerun app.py.
